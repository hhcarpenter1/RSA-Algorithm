How to use program:

Enciphering:

1) Click on green arrow, then click OK to run the program.

2) Type in a message on your keyboard to encrypt a message

3) You will receive output for the encrypted message and the decrypted message. Everything will be in caps with no punctuation

Design:

-I divided my program into four separate classes with four unique responsibilities: KeyGeneration, Decryption, Encryption, and User interface. 

-The KeyGeneration class contains the formulas for n (the modulus), e, eulerTotient, max, and d

-The Encryption and Decryption classes both use Hashtables to efficiently assign chars to ascII int values and vice versa.
-Before the Hashtable assigning, the encrypted values were broken into pairs of two letters. Then, I encoded the characters into ascII values including the spaces.

-The encryption and decryption methods use a few toString methods, so the output can be comprehendable.

-To improve on the design on this project from the previous one, I tried to encapsulate my classes, methods, and variables by avoiding 'static' or class.method().
